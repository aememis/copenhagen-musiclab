# copenhagen-musiclab-concert

This repo is for clapping analysis of motion data recorded during the MusicLab Copenhagen Concert.
During the concert, audience members placed mobile phones on their chests which allowed us to collect their motion data while they are experiencing the concert. 

- [clapping_motion.ipynb](clapping_motion.ipynb) -> Throughout the concert, 15 clappings occurred either after speeches or musical pieces or at the end of the concert. This notebook preprocesses the accelerometer data of 75 participants during these clapping sections and extracts features of clappings.
